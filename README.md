# Google_Foo_Bar
The fabled Google Foo Bar challange appeared in my browser after some technical google searches. For the few weeks that followed I completed six of the increasingly difficult challanges in between school work.

The problems were extremely fun and challanging. To anyone who has the luck to see "You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?" in their browser I definitely recommend you accept.
